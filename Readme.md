# Face and Text Emotion Detection System

This is a Flask-based web application that detects emotions from both **facial expressions** (via webcam) and **text input** (using NLP). It leverages deep learning models built with TensorFlow and OpenCV for real-time performance.

## 🔥 Features

- 🎥 Real-time face emotion detection using webcam
- ✍️ Text emotion classification using LSTM + GloVe embeddings
- 😊 Dynamic emoji display based on predicted emotions
- 📊 Integrated confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy metrics
- 🌐 Flask-powered UI with HTML, CSS (Poppins font)

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 3.10  
- TensorFlow (2.12 / 2.19)
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- GloVe (100d word embeddings)
- HTML, CSS (frontend)
